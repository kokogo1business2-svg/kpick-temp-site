# K-Pick Website App Operations Manual

Generated: 2026-05-10  
Project folder: `C:\WebDraft`  
Application: K-Pick Trading Corp website, quote/PO builder, staff dashboard, and quote PDF backend

## 1. Emergency Quick Start

If the website or PO system is down, do these checks in order.

1. Open the health check:
   - Local: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health`
   - Railway: open the deployed site URL and add `/api/health`

2. If health returns JSON with `"ok": true`, the backend is running. Try:
   - Customer quote page: `/request.htm`
   - Staff dashboard: `/request-admin.htm`

3. If the health check does not load, check the host:
   - Railway: open the service logs and confirm `npm start` is running.
   - Local PC: run `npm run dev` from `C:\WebDraft`.

4. If the staff dashboard opens but login fails, confirm the staff account exists and is active. Admin can reset staff passwords in `/request-admin.htm`.

5. If products show old prices or stock, log in as Admin and press `Sync Sheet`. If that fails, check the Google Sheet CSV URL and backend logs.

6. If generated PDFs fail, confirm the PO exists, the PDF link includes a token, or the staff user is logged in.

7. If data appears missing after deployment, check `KPICK_DATA_DIR`. The SQLite database must live on a persistent Railway volume. Without a persistent volume, new deployments can start with an empty database.

## 2. What This App Does

This repository contains a public website and an internal operations backend.

Public pages:
- `index.html`: homepage and brand overview.
- `sungshim.html`, `hansol.html`, `erop.html`: brand landing pages.
- Product detail pages such as `sungshim-insulin-syringe.html` and `erop-trocar.html`.
- `contact.htm`: contact form using Web3Forms.
- `request.htm`: customer quote / PO request builder.

Staff page:
- `request-admin.htm`: login dashboard for Admin, CS, Inventory, Manager, and Boss roles.

Backend:
- `backend/server.mjs`: Node server that serves static files, products, quote requests, staff login, admin actions, reports, Google Sheet inventory sync, and quote PDFs.
- `backend/server.py`: fallback Python server kept in the repo, but the active deployment uses Node.

Deployment:
- `railway.json`: Railway config. It runs `npm install`, starts with `npm start`, and checks `/api/health`.

## 3. Important Files

- `package.json`: Node scripts and dependency list.
- `.nvmrc`: required Node major version, currently `24`.
- `railway.json`: Railway build/start/health settings.
- `backend/server.mjs`: main app server and API.
- `backend/seed_products.json`: starting product catalog inserted into SQLite.
- `backend/google-sheet-inventory-template.csv`: expected Google Sheet column format.
- `css/style.css`: all page styling.
- `script/request-po.js`: customer quote builder logic.
- `script/request-admin.js`: staff dashboard logic.
- `script/request-products.js`: local fallback product list if API is unavailable.
- `backend/data/kpick_quote.sqlite3`: local SQLite database when `KPICK_DATA_DIR` is not set. This folder is ignored by Git.
- `backend/data/server.log`: local backend log when `KPICK_DATA_DIR` is not set.

## 4. Runtime Requirements

Required:
- Node.js 24 or newer.
- npm.
- Writable data folder for SQLite.

The backend uses Node's built-in `node:sqlite`, so Node 24+ is required. Older Node versions can fail immediately on startup.

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run locally:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open locally:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/request.htm
http://127.0.0.1:8000/request-admin.htm
```

Production start command:

```powershell
npm start
```

## 5. Environment Variables

Set these in Railway variables or before starting locally.

Required in hosted production:
- `KPICK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: fallback admin password and initial default account password.
- `KPICK_AUTH_SECRET`: long random secret used to sign staff tokens and PDF links.

Strongly recommended:
- `KPICK_DATA_DIR`: persistent directory for SQLite and logs. On Railway, set this to the mounted volume path, commonly `/data`.
- `KPICK_AUTO_SYNC_INVENTORY`: `1` to sync on startup and schedule, `0` to disable.
- `KPICK_INVENTORY_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS`: default `1800000` or 30 minutes.
- `KPICK_INVENTORY_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`: default `15000`.
- `KPICK_INVENTORY_CSV_URL`: Google Sheet CSV export URL. If not set, the app uses the URL hardcoded in `backend/server.mjs`.
- `KPICK_HOST`: optional. The app binds to `0.0.0.0` automatically when Railway provides `PORT`.
- `KPICK_PORT`: optional local override. Default is `8000`; Railway uses `PORT`.

Generate a strong auth secret:

```powershell
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Do not commit real secrets to Git.

## 6. Railway Deployment Notes

Railway reads `railway.json`.

Build command:

```text
npm install
```

Start command:

```text
npm start
```

Health check:

```text
/api/health
```

Before production use, confirm:
- A persistent Railway volume is attached.
- `KPICK_DATA_DIR` points to that volume.
- `KPICK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set.
- `KPICK_AUTH_SECRET` is set.
- The service logs show `K-Pick backend running`.
- `/api/health` returns JSON.

If Railway redeploys and all POs disappear, the most likely cause is that SQLite was stored in a temporary filesystem instead of a volume.

## 7. Data Storage

SQLite tables created by `backend/server.mjs`:

- `products`: product catalog, stock, price, carton discount data, active flag, sync timestamp.
- `quote_requests`: customer PO requests, items JSON, totals JSON, workflow fields, deleted/cancelled metadata.
- `staff_users`: staff accounts, password hashes, manager code hashes, role, active flag.
- `quote_audit_log`: important staff actions and changes.

Default local database path:

```text
backend/data/kpick_quote.sqlite3
```

Production database path:

```text
KPICK_DATA_DIR/kpick_quote.sqlite3
```

Backup the SQLite file regularly. To restore, stop the service, replace the SQLite file with a known good backup, then restart.

## 8. Default Staff Accounts

On first startup, the app creates default local accounts:

- `admin` / default password / Admin
- `cs001` / default password / CS
- `inv001` / default password / Inventory
- `mgr001` / default password / Manager
- `boss001` / default password / Boss

The default password comes from `KPICK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; locally it falls back to `kpick0324admin`.

After first deployment:
- Log in as `admin`.
- Create named staff accounts.
- Reset default passwords.
- Keep at least one active Admin account.

Admin can add, edit, rename, reset passwords/codes, and deactivate staff accounts from `/request-admin.htm`.

## 9. Staff Roles And Permissions

Admin:
- Can view and modify all POs.
- Can sync Google Sheet inventory.
- Can manage staff accounts.
- Can edit products, totals, workflow, customer details, and staff assignment.
- Can delete/cancel eligible POs.

CS:
- Can update customer details.
- Can add SI number.
- Must assign inventory staff after entering SI number.
- Can change products, quantities, prices, or totals only before payment/generated workflow and only with a Manager/Admin manager code.
- Can delete/cancel unpaid generated POs when customer cancelled or is unreachable.

Inventory:
- Can update PO condition only for assigned POs.
- Allowed conditions: `Picking Products`, `For Repacking`, `Ready for Shipment`, `Released / Shipped`.
- Can mark ready for shipment when assigned.

Manager:
- Can view work queue and reports.
- Manager code authorizes CS order, price, and total revisions.

Boss:
- Can view work queue and reports.

## 10. Normal PO Workflow

1. Customer or staff opens `/request.htm`.
2. They enter customer details.
3. They select products and quantities.
4. The app calculates subtotal, carton discount, and grand total.
5. They press `Submit Request`.
6. Backend saves the request and returns a generated PO number and PDF link.
7. Staff opens `/request-admin.htm`.
8. CS logs in and reviews new generated POs.
9. CS enters SI number and assigns Inventory staff.
10. PO moves to `Pending for Picking`.
11. Assigned Inventory staff updates condition through:
    - `Picking Products`
    - `For Repacking`
    - `Ready for Shipment`
    - `Released / Shipped`
12. Manager/Boss/Admin can review reports.

Workflow statuses:
- `Generated`
- `Pending for Picking`
- `Picking Products`
- `For Repacking`
- `Ready for Shipment`
- `Released / Shipped`

## 11. Product And Inventory Sync

Seed products are in:

```text
backend/seed_products.json
```

Google Sheet sync expects columns like:

```text
sku,brand,category,product_name,packaging,carton_packing,gauge,stock_quantity,stock_unit,unit_price,active,last_updated,notes
```

The current backend sync updates existing SKUs. It does not create brand-new unknown SKUs from the Sheet. If a new SKU is needed:

1. Add it to `backend/seed_products.json`.
2. Deploy/restart so the seed runs.
3. Add matching SKU row in the Google Sheet.
4. Use Admin `Sync Sheet`.

The sync mainly updates:
- Product name.
- Category.
- Stock quantity.
- Stock unit.
- Unit price.
- Last synced timestamp.

Auto sync:
- On server startup, if `KPICK_AUTO_SYNC_INVENTORY` is not `0`.
- Every 30 minutes by default.

Manual sync:
- Log in as Admin at `/request-admin.htm`.
- Press `Sync Sheet`.

## 12. Quote PDF Behavior

PDFs are generated by `backend/server.mjs` using `pdfkit`.

PDF endpoint:

```text
GET /api/quote-requests/:id/pdf
```

Access is allowed when:
- The PDF URL includes a valid signed token, or
- A logged-in staff user with a valid role requests it.

The PDF includes:
- K-Pick logo when `img/KpickLogoDark.png` exists.
- PO number.
- Created date.
- Customer details.
- Selected products.
- Unit price, quantity, discount, line total.
- Subtotal, carton discount, grand total.

If a PDF URL stops working, generate a new PO modal link from the app or open it while logged in.

## 13. API Reference

## 14. Troubleshooting

Problem: App will not start.
- Check Node version with `node -v`; must be 24+.
- Run `npm install`.
- Confirm `KPICK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `KPICK_AUTH_SECRET` are set when hosted.
- Check Railway logs or `backend/data/server.log`.

Problem: `/api/health` works but pages 404.
- Confirm static files exist in the project root.
- Use exact filenames such as `/request.htm` and `/request-admin.htm`.
- The backend intentionally blocks private paths like `/backend/` and `/node_modules/`.

Problem: Quote page says it is using local draft product list.
- Product API failed or backend is not serving `/api/products`.
- Check `/api/health`.
- Confirm the page is opened through the Node backend, not just double-clicked as a local file.

Problem: Staff dashboard says API did not return JSON.
- Open dashboard through backend URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:8000/request-admin.htm`.
- Do not open `request-admin.htm` directly from the filesystem.

Problem: Staff cannot log in.
- Confirm ID number and password.
- Admin can reset password in Staff Accounts.
- Confirm the staff user is active.

Problem: CS cannot save an SI workflow update.
- CS must assign Inventory staff before saving after SI number is entered.

Problem: CS cannot change product/price/quantity.
- The PO may already be paid or beyond `Generated`.
- CS changes to products, price, quantity, removals, or totals require a Manager/Admin manager code.

Problem: Inventory cannot update a PO.
- Inventory can only update assigned POs.
- Confirm CS assigned the correct Inventory ID/name.

Problem: Google Sheet sync fails.
- Confirm the Sheet is published or available as CSV.
- Confirm the URL in `KPICK_INVENTORY_CSV_URL` or `backend/server.mjs`.
- Confirm the Sheet has a `sku` column.
- Check logs for timeout or HTTP status.

Problem: New SKU in Google Sheet does not appear.
- Add the SKU to `backend/seed_products.json` first, then restart/deploy and sync.

Problem: Data disappeared after deploy.
- Confirm Railway has a persistent volume.
- Confirm `KPICK_DATA_DIR` points to the mounted volume.
- Restore from SQLite backup if necessary.

Problem: Contact form does not send.
- `contact.htm` posts to Web3Forms.
- Confirm the hidden `access_key` in `contact.htm` is valid.
- If Web3Forms is down, customers can email `kpickmedicalmarketing@gmail.com`.

## 15. Safe Maintenance Checklist

Before editing:
- Run `git status --short`.
- Make a copy of the SQLite database if changing backend logic.
- Confirm you know whether changes are for static pages, dashboard JS, or backend routes.

After editing:
- Run local server.
- Check `/api/health`.
- Open `/request.htm`.
- Create a test PO.
- Download the generated PDF.
- Log in to `/request-admin.htm`.
- Update workflow as CS/Admin.
- If inventory logic changed, test assignment and Inventory login.
- If deployment changed, verify Railway logs and `/api/health`.

Before production deployment:
- Make sure no secrets are committed.
- Make sure `.env` and `backend/data/` are not committed.
- Confirm `railway.json` still uses `npm start`.
- Confirm Node version remains compatible with `node:sqlite`.

## 16. Backup And Recovery

What to back up:
- SQLite database file: `kpick_quote.sqlite3`.
- Current code repository.
- Railway environment variable values.
- Google Sheet inventory source.

Suggested backup routine:
- Download/copy the SQLite file at least daily while POs are actively generated.
- Keep backups with date/time in the filename.
- Keep one backup before every code deployment.

Restore routine:
1. Stop the running backend service.
2. Copy the known good SQLite file into `KPICK_DATA_DIR`.
3. Start the service.
4. Open `/api/health`.
5. Log in to `/request-admin.htm` and confirm recent POs appear.

## 17. Developer Notes

Frontend pages are plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no build step for the frontend.

Backend is a single Node module:

```text
backend/server.mjs
```

The server:
- Creates/migrates tables at startup.
- Seeds default staff accounts.
- Seeds products from `backend/seed_products.json`.
- Optionally syncs inventory from Google Sheet.
- Serves public static files.
- Blocks backend and dependency files from public static access.

Current npm scripts:

```json
{
  "dev": "node --watch backend/server.mjs",
  "start": "node backend/server.mjs"
}
```

## 18. Handoff Summary

If the owner is unavailable, the app can still be managed by someone who has:
- Railway access.
- Repository access.
- Staff Admin login.
- Google Sheet access.
- SQLite backup access.

The most critical operational facts are:
- Use Node 24+.
- Keep `KPICK_DATA_DIR` on persistent storage.
- Keep `KPICK_AUTH_SECRET` stable; changing it invalidates existing sessions and signed PDF links.
- Back up SQLite.
- Manage staff users through Admin dashboard.
- Add new SKUs to seed data before expecting Google Sheet sync to update them.
